This document outlines our privacy policy for consumer visitors to our web site.  If you are a consumer who has a continuing relationship with us, please see our   Privacy Notice  for additional details about our treatment of your personal information.  </span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Visitors to Our Web Site.</strong> Visitors to our web site remain anonymous, unless they register for a service or otherwise elect to disclose their identity to us. Although we do not collect personally identifying information about persons who simply visit our site, we do collect certain limited information about visitors, such as their IP address (a numeric address assigned automatically to computers when they access the Internet). We also may place "cookies" on a computer to track a visitor's use of our web site. A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your hard drive. It takes up very little room on your system and helps us to customize our site and make its navigation easier for you. We sometimes use cookies to help estimate the number of visitors to our site and to determine which areas are the most popular. Unless you register with us for a service (such as our online banking service), the cookie does not provide us with </span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Our Collection of Information About You.</strong>  We may collect nonpublic personal information about you in order to understand your needs, administer our business, process transactions, and provide you with products and services. We obtain nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources when you request or obtain services from us:</span></p><ul><li><span>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms (such as your name, address, social security number, assets and income); </span></li><li><span>Information about your transactions with us or others (such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions, and credit usage); and </span></li><li><span>Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency (such as your creditworthiness and credit history). </span></li></ul><br /><p><span><strong>Our Disclosure of That Information.</strong>  We may disclose information about you, your accounts and transactions: (a) where it is necessary or helpful to effect, process or confirm your transactions; (b) to verify the existence, history and condition of your account for credit reporting agencies; (c) to comply with legal process, such as subpoenas and court orders; (d) to law enforcement authorities if we believe a crime has been committed; (e) if you give us your consent; and (f) as otherwise permitted by law.</span></p><br /><p><span>We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about our current or former customers to others, except as set forth in our Privacy Notice </p><br /><p><span><strong>"Do Not Track" Settings</strong>. Your Internet browser may contain tools to request that web sites not track your online activities.  Industry standards for this technology are evolving and we currently do not respond to or take any action with respect to the "do not track" settings in your Internet browser.</span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Online Activity</strong>. There are a number of third parties (e.g., social media companies and advertising networks) that may build profiles based on your browsing activity across one or more web sites over time.  That information may be used, among other things, to target specific advertisements to you.  If a third party cookie or similar tracking device is placed on your computer by one of these companies, it may be able to collect information about your browsing activity at our web site.  In addition, our web site may contain advertisements, tools, or other services provided by third parties that may collect information about your online browsing activities over time and across different websites.  If you provide us with nonpublic personal information about yourself, we do not share that information with third-parties except in accordance these terms and our Privacy Notice.  </span></p><br /><p><span><strong>State Rights. </strong>Depending on where you live, you may have additional privacy protections under some state laws. For example, certain state laws may restrict the types of information we may disclose about you, limit the parties with whom we may share such information, or require us to provide you with additional notices or opt-out rights. We will comply with applicable state laws before sharing nonpublic personal information about you. We may do this by sending a separate notice of those rights to you.</span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Maintaining Accurate Information.</strong> We have procedures in place that help us to maintain the accuracy of the personally identifiable information that we collect. Please contact our customer service center at <?php echo $phone; ?>, if you believe that our information about you is incomplete, out-of-date, or incorrect.  If you are an online banking customer of ours, visit our website at www.<?php echo $url; ?> to review and correct information about yourself, such as a change in your name, address or e-mail address.</span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Information Security.</strong> We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who have a need to know such information (e.g., to process your transactions or provide services to you). We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. </span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Links to Other Web Sites.</strong> Our web site may feature links to third party web sites that offer goods, services or information. Some of these sites may appear as windows-within-windows at this site. When you click on one of these links, you will be leaving our site and will no longer be subject to this policy. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of the other web sites that you visit and urge you to review their privacy policies before you provide them with any personally identifiable information. Third party sites may collect and use information about you in a way that is different from this policy. </span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Services and Advertisements by Third Parties.</strong> Third parties may offer services from time to time at our web site. If you provide them with information, their use of that information will be subject to their privacy policy, if any, and will not be subject to this policy. If you accept third party goods or services advertised at our web site, the third party may be able to identify that you have a relationship with us (e.g., if the offer was only made through our site).</span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Minors. </strong>We feel strongly about protecting the privacy of children and teenagers. As such, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from minors through our web site. </span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Changes to this Policy. </strong>We may add to, delete, or change the terms of this Consumer Online Privacy Policy from time to time by sending you a notice or posting a notice of the change (or an amended Consumer Online Privacy Policy) at this web site. If required by law, we will send you a notice of the change. Your continued use of our web site or any online service following notification will constitute your agreement to the revised Consumer Online Privacy Policy. </span></p><br /><p><span><strong>Questions.</strong> If you have any questions regarding this Consumer Online Privacy Policy, you can call us at <?php echo $phone; ?>.</span></p><br /><br /><br /></div></div></div></div></div><div id="footer" class=""><div id="" class="inner"><div id="copyrightNotice" class=""><img src="custom/ppbi2/image/logo-footer.png" alt="Custom Image"/><p>Copyright © 2018 - All rights reserved.</p></div><ul id="footerNav" class="nthTier-1"><li class="even nthChild-1 firstChild"><a class="even nthChild-1 firstChild" href="security-fraud-alerts/fraud-alerts.php" title="Security and Cyber Threat Center">Security and Cyber Threat Center</a></li><li class="odd nthChild-2"><a class="odd nthChild-2" href="homeowners-assistance.php" title="Homeowners Assistance">Homeowners Assistance</a></li><li class="inPath selected even nthChild-3"><a class="inPath selected even nthChild-3" href="online-privacy-policy.php" title="Online Privacy Policy">Online Privacy Policy</a></li><li class="odd nthChild-4"><a class="odd nthChild-4" href="terms-of-use.php" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a></li></ul><div id="firstROI"><a href="#"><img src="custom/ppbi2/image/powered-by-bvi.png" alt="Powered by BVI"/></a></div><div id="fdic" class=""><a href="http://www.fdic.gov/" class="confirm" target="_blank"><img src="custom/ppbi2/image/fdic.png" alt="Member FDIC"/></a></div><div id="eh" class=""><a href="http://portal.hud.gov/portal/page/portal/HUD/" class="confirm "></a></div></div></div></body>
